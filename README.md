Project 1: Predicting the reasons of Attrition of the employees of a company
Created two machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict the cause for attrition of 
employees in a company. Attained 89% accuracy in Logistic Regression Model.

Project 2:Creating and training models to predict the successful recovery of a rocket's part
Developed four Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and K 
Nearest Neighbors) for new SpaceY company who wants to bid against Tesla’s SpaceX company to predict successful 
recovery of a rocket’s part as SpaceX is successful in it.Collected data from public SpaceX API and SpaceX Wikipedia page and created models. All models produced similar 
results with accuracy rate of about 83.33%.
